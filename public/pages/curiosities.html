                so it might be messy and will probably also stay messy.</p>

            <h3>Font on this website</h3>
            <p>I knew I wanted some kind of pixelated retro feeling font. 
                When looking around the web for this, I found a website archiving a ton of old BIOS and system fonts.
                <a href="https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/" target="_blank" >int10h</a> holds an absolutely crazy amount of these fonts, free to 
                download in various formats (They even have corrected aspect ratio's on fonts for monitors that didn't have square pixels!!!).
                The font you can see here is <i>IBM DOS ISO8</i>.
